# Settings

ChromaToggle has a couple settings in UserPrefs that most players won't need to mess with.  These settings, as well as their descriptions and functions, are listed below.  

# THIS GUIDE IS NOT COMPLETE

## Safety Warning  
Certain features of ChromaToggle have some potentially "health aversive" mechanics, therefore I need you to agree to some kind of "hey I'm not liable" agreement to enable them.  Outlined below is a list of features requiring safety warning, and why they require this warning.  

**Nightmare** - Flashing lights are involved, and static lights cannot prevent them.  Therefore an epilepsy warning is required.  Don't play Nightmare if you have epilepsy.  There.  You have been warned.  
Also, Nightmare is EXTREMELY HARD.  If you're an Expert+ player, *expect to die on Hard difficulty maps.*  
**Breaking Reality** - This one is hard to explain, but if you are even a little bit prone to VR sickness, *do not break reality*.  Each eye will see different things, and it is *extremely disorienting*.  

There.  You have now read the safety warnings.  I hope you're happy.  You enable the modes outlined above, create a *IDoReadSafetyWarnings=* option in the ModPrefs.ini file, under the [ChromaToggle] section, and set the right side of the equals sign to *ISwearIReadIt*.  If you are having difficulty doing this, *DO NOT ASK FOR HELP DOING SO, BECAUSE IF YOU CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO ADD A LINE TO THE PREFERENCE FILE, YOU CANNOT BE TRUSTED WITH YOUR OWN HEALTH*.
I swear to god if you just added that option without reading it, the value, or the safety warning, I will come to your house and I will stab you in technicolour.
