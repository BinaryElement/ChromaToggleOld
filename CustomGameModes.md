Custom Game Modes can be placed in the **UserData/ChromaToggle/CustomGamemodes** folder.  
Custom modes are composed of XML files, with a plethora of options to tweak to your hearts content.

It's recommended to start with an existing custom gamemode file to alter.  Copies of the official gamemodes (including default) come with ChromaToggle, but you can also [download the default gamemode here](https://discordapp.com/channels/488923582370545664/502961900846579732/504855424059572236).
