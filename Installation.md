# Installation

ChromaToggle has a two-part installation.  First, you need the dependencies through the regular mod installer (at [modsaber.org](https://www.modsaber.org/)), then you need to install ChromaToggle itself.

## Dependencies

* Run the mod installer.  If you don't know what that means, you need to take a step back and look at other Beat Saber mods.  ChromaToggle is an advanced mod, and you should be well versed in modding Beat Saber before attempting to use this mod.  
* Install/Update these three plugins:
  * Beat Saber Utils (also known as BS_Utils)
  * Custom UI (also known as BeatSaberCustomUI)
  * Harmony
* Additional Notes
  * There is an old version of CustomSabers that breaks a lot of plugins - ChromaToggle included.  **If you use CustomSabers, update it**.
  * ChromaToggle is not especially compatible with DarthMaul plugin.  But that's okay, because ChromaToggle has its own darth maul.
* You've completed the first step!

## ChromaToggle Installation

When you download ChromaToggle, you should be provided with a zip file.  The easiest way to install is to simply place that zip file in your **main Beat Saber directory** - the same folder that has BeatSaber.exe in it.  Then simply extract it to that location.

If this is your first installation, the folders inside the zip MUST be merged with the folders in your Beat Saber directory.  Don't worry, this won't override anything, it simply installs ChromaToggle relevant stuff in their own locations.

If this is not your first installation, I still recommend you merge these folders.  It will only override stuff like audio files and the example custom gamemodes - any customization you have done should not be overridden.

And congratulations, you are now ready for ChromaToggle!
