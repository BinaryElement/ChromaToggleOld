# Compatibility
ChromaToggle is not compatible with the following plugins:
* Hidden (HD)
* Custom Colours - ChromaToggle does everything CC does and better anyway
* SimplestRainbowMod - Again, ChromaToggle can do everything it does anyway
* DarthMaul - ChromaToggle can give you TWO darth mauls!
  * DarthMaul is technically compatible but it will make your gameplay options menu weird

[Download it from the releases page.](https://github.com/BinaryElement/ChromaToggle/releases)
