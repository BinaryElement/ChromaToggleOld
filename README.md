# ChromaToggle v0.6
### "The Customization Sensation"

Here at ChromaToggle® we value your eye-cone-thingies.  
A recent trend of duochromitis has plagued the VR community these last few months, and we've decided to balance the playing field.  

ChromaToggle® can bring you up from your sad, rainbowless life into a world of Pentachrome™ magic.  Experience the joy of having up to six different colours of blocks flying towards you at break neck speed!  If that's not enough for you, we even offer a cacophony of Technicolour© lightwaves, to bring your eyes to their knees!

ChromaToggle® can take any map you already know and love and turn it into something much more intense, with its **On-The-Fly** (OTF) map tweak system!  Take any two hand map and play it with one hand!  Take any one hand map and play it with four hands!  The possibilities are endless!

ChromaToggle™ also boasts the most power in colour customization you've ever seen, allowing you to customize blocks, lights, sabers, and barriers into not just one but multiple colours!  Standard gameplay works as you would expect, but we also offer you Pentachrome lighting to bring your duochrome world to the next (three) levels!  And if that's not enough for you, **Technicolour** is a fully customizeable, palette based version of Rainbow mode, that can be applied to blocks, lights, sabers, barriers, in any combination!

Or, if you're the sort to prefer hand crafted perfection (hence Beat Saber), mappers can place blocks and lights of all the above types!  But that's not all, ChromaToggle®™© even offers **full RGB control* of lightmaps!  Give *Liquid's* example map, *Chromakey Lightshow* a play and see how much more *colourful* your world can be!  
(Play on Easy difficulty for just a lightshow, Expert for Pentachrome Toggle mode)

Finally, if you're more averse to colours, we bring you *Nightmare Mode* for halloween!  It's a dark cold world out there, and it wants to kill you, so maybe you should stay in here, where it's colourful...
