# ChromaToggle
### "Because everything else is just extra"

This is an early version of ChromaToggle, which features many features, not bugs, stop asking questions.

This plugin is only active in Party Mode.

## Settings

All the settings can be found in the standard ModPrefs ini file.  After changing the ModPrefs settings, you can press backslash ( \\ ) while the game is focused to reload the settings without rebooting Beat Saber.  You will hear a sound to indicate a successful reload of settings.  This sound was definitely not stolen from Discord.  Nope.

### enableSaberToggle
**Default: false**
This is the founding feature of ChromaToggle.
With this enabled, your sabers will change colour while holding the trigger.  
Both sabers will be blue by default, and toggle to red while holding the trigger.
*Not compatible with darth maul mode*.

### alternateToggle
**Default: false**
This inverts your left saber, making it red by default and blue while holding the trigger.  This is akin to regular gameplay while not toggling, but this makes toggling much harder to wrap your head around.

### permanentToggle
**Default: false**
This changes the toggle system from hold to press - you will need to press the trigger twice to revert it back to its original colour.

### enableOneColourMode
**Default: false**
Forces all notes and sabers to be blue.

### enableDoubleHits [NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED]
**Default: true**
Deletes notes from double hits, forcing them to be single hits.

### enableMonoDoubles
**Default: false**
Forces all double or greater hits to be one colour.  This greatly alleviates issues with strikes using more than two notes combined with randomization, and makes toggling much easier to wrap your head around.

### enableAllDots
**Default: false**
This forces all notes to be dots.  This differs from No Arrows Mode in that the colour randomization is not applied (and of course that you can stack it with other party mode features).

### enableDotDoubles
**Default: false**
Forces all double hits to be dots.  This is a good alternative to disabling double hits entirely.

### enableColourRand
**Default: false**
This is the no-arrows-mode randomization feature, however it can be activated or deactivated separately from dot mode.  This is a good way to make regular maps more interesting with saber toggling enabled.

### enableDarthMaul
**Default: false**
Darth maul!  DARTH MAUL!  **DARTH MAUL!**
*Does not stack with Saber Toggle.*
*enableMantisStyle will flip your maul around.*

### doubleDarthMaul
**Default: false**
Darth Maul!  DARTH MAUL!  **DARTH MAUL!**
Darth Maul!  DARTH MAUL!  **DARTH MAUL!**
*Does not stack with Saber Toggle.*
*enableAlternateToggle will flip the left maul.*
*enableMantisStyle will flip both mauls.*

### enableMantisStyle
**Default: false**
Flips your sabers around so you can play mantis style without physically flipping your controller.

### darthMantisOffset
**Default: 0.25**
This adjusts the forward position of your saber(s) for Darth Maul or Mantis Style.  Default recommended.

### useOculusButton
**Default: false**
This is meant to let you use the buttons on the oculus instead of the triggers, but this is unconfirmed.
